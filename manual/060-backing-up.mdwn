Backing up
==========

This chapter discusses the various aspects of making backups with
Obnam.

Your first backup
-----------------

This section describes how to use Obnam to make the first backup. It
also discusses how to deal with precious data being very large, when
you can't let the backup run for days at a time. The checkpoints are
discussed. Progress reporting is discussed, as is the overall
performance statisics reported by Obnam at the end of a backup.

Your second backup
------------------

This section describes how to use Obnam to run additional backups. It
also describes how to list backup generations, so that you can be sure
that you're actually making backups.

Choosing what to backup, and what not to backup
-----------------------------------------------

This section describes how to configure Obnam to include all precious
data in the backup, but exclude that which is not interesting to
backup. `root`, `exclude`, `exclude-caches`, `one-file-system` are all
discussed here.

De-duplication
--------------

This section discusses Obnam's de-duplication features, and when you
might not want to use them, and when the "verify" mode is relevant.

Locking
-------

This section discusses Obnam's approach to locking parts of the
repository during backups, and what to do if the backup process
crashes and leaves lock files around.

Consistency of live data
------------------------

This section discusses how to handle backing up a live filesystem,
which is being used and changed while the backup runs. It discusses
LVM snapshots, btrfs subvolumes, MySQL database dumps.
