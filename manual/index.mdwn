% Backups with Obnam
% Lars Wirzenius

FIXME: It would be good to have case studies for how to set up Obnam
for specific use cases.

Introduction
============

This is the manual for Obnam, a backup tool.

You know you should
===================

This chapter is philosophical and theoretical about backups.
It discusses why you should back up, various concepts around backups,
what kinds of things you should think about when setting up backups
and what to do in the long term (verification, etc). It also discusses
some assumptions Obnam makes and some constraints it imposes.

Installing Obnam
================

I really don't want to write this chapter, so I'll stick to just
telling people using Debian or Ubuntu how to install it with the
package manager, and how to build and install it from source. I expect
this chapter will get patches from various distros and operating
systems to explain their installation details.

Backing up
==========

This chapter discusses how to set up a backup repository, and running
your backup for the first time, plus how to do incremental backups. It
also shows how to look at the backups you've made so you have some
confidence the backups happened.

Restoring from backups
======================

This chapter discusses how to restore data from any backup generation,
either everything or individual files. It describes both the approach
using just Obnam, and the approach using the FUSE filesystem.

Forgetting old backup generations
=================================

This chapter will discuss how to remove old backup generations, and
various considerations on the aspects of what to keep and for how
long.

Obnam configuration files and settings
======================================

This chapter is a reference manual for all the configuration settings
in Obnam, and what their meaning is, and what their sensible use is,
including examples and everything. It also explains configuration file
location and syntax, with examples.

Sharing a repository between multiple clients
=============================================

This chapter discusses what needs to be done to share a backup
repository between clients, and why that might be useful, and when not
to do that.

Using encryption
================

This chapter discusses how to encrypt the backup repository, and how
to manage encryption keys.

Other stuff
===========

This chapter discusses topics that do not warrant a chapter of their
own, such as compressing backups.
