Every new feature must have a unit test. Unit tests go into *Tests.py,
and are run by testrun.py (which is invoked by "make check").

Black box tests are run by the "blackboxtests" script. It, too, is run
by "make check".

Every bug fix must have a unit test or black box regression test.

Do not commit to trunk unless "make check" passes.

Every function, class, method, and file must have a comment or doc string.
