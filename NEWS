Obnam NEWS
==========


This file summarizes changes between releases of Obnam.

Version 0.7, released 2007-04-01

    * This is not an April Fool's joke.
    
    * "obnam restore" can now restore individual files or directories
      (and all files and directories within those directories).
    
    * Log files are now opened so they're readable only by the owner. This
      is better for security.
      
    * obnamfs now has a manual page. The main obnam manual page now includes
      examples of usage.

Version 0.6, released 2007-03-06
    
    * Manual page updates.
    
    * odirect_read now works under Linux kernel 2.4.
    
    * --progress reports final numbers at the end of the backup, and
      doesn't mess up the output under screen(1).
      
    * Log file time stamps are now absolute, instead of being relative to
      the beginning of the program.
      
    * There is a preliminary FUSE filesystem for browsing and reading
      backups made with Obnam.
      
    * A problem with caching combined with encryption was fixed.

Version 0.5, released 2007-02-15

    * Debian packaging much improved.

Version 0.4, released 2007-02-15

    * odirect_read now works over Samba and other network filesystems.
      It does not use O_DIRECT in those cases, since that won't work,
      but backups can be made, at the expense of some disk cache flushing.

Version 0.3, released 2007-02-13

    * Now uses the rsync algorithm for handling changed files.

    * sftp transport.
    
    * Encryption of backups.
    
    * Reads files by bypassing the operating system disk cache, so that
      doing a backup doesn't fill the cache with useless stuff.
      
    * Support for configuration files.
    
    * Possibility to exclude files using regular expressions on pathnames.
      
    * Many speed improvements.
    
    * Optional progress indication.
    
    * Numerous other small improvements.

Version 0.1, released 2006-11-12

    * First alpha release. The code is completely rewritten from earlier
      prototypes. Data formats have changed and old formats are not
      supported.
