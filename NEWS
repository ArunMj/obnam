Obnam NEWS
==========


This file summarizes changes between releases of Obnam.

Version 0.12, released 2010-07-11; an ALPHA release
----------------------------------------------------

* NOTE: This version makes incompatible changes to the way data is stored
  on-disk. Backups made with older versions are NOT supported. Sorry.
* The run-benchmark script has dropped some smaller sizes (they're too
  fast to be interesting), and adds a 10 GiB test size.
* Various speed optimizations. Most importantly, the way file metadata
  (results of lstat(2)) are encoded has changed. This is the incompatible
  change from above. It's much faster now, though.
* Preliminary support for using SFTP for the backup store added. Hasn't
  been used much yet, so might well be very buggy.


Version 0.11, released 2010-07-05; an ALPHA release
----------------------------------------------------

* Speed optimizations:
  - chunk identifiers are now sequential, except for the first one, or
    when there's a collision
  - chunks are now stored in a more sensible directory hierarchy (instead
    of one per directory, on average)
  - adding files to a directory in the backup store is now faster
  - only store a file's metadata that if it is changed
* New --exclude=regexp option to exclude files based on pathnames
* Obnam now makes checkpoints during backups. If a backup is aborted
  in the middle and then re-started, it will continue from the latest
  checkpoint rather than from the beginning of the previous backup run.
  - New option --checkpoint to set the interval between checkpoints.
    Defaults to 1 GiB.
* Options for various B-tree settings. This is mostly useful for finding
  the optimal set of defaults, but may be useful in other situations for
  some people.
  - New options --chunk-group-size, --chunk-size, --node-size,
    --upload-queue-size.
* Somewhat better progress reporting during backups.


Version 0.10, released 2010-06-29; an ALPHA release
---------------------------------------------------

* Rewritten from scratch.
* Old NEWS file entries removed (see bzr if you're interested).
