A copy of the GPL version 2 is included in the file COPYING.

The file uuid.py is a separate work, included here for convenience.
A future version will be included in Python 2.5. It is licensed under
the Python Software Foundation License used by Python itself. From
the author:

    uuid.py is now released in the Python Package Index (see python.org)
    and will be included in Python 2.5, so it is under the Python
    license like the rest of Python.

Since Obnam supports Python 2.4, uuid.py is included here.
