ObnamFS: Backups as a read-only FUSE filesystem
-----------------------------------------------

In order to make browsing and restoring as pleasant as possible, backups
made with Obnam are available as a read-only filesystem, implemented
using FUSE.

To use this, make sure your system supports FUSE. Then run the 
following command:

    obnamfs MOUNTPOINT
    
where MOUNTPOINT is the location (directory) where you want your backups
to be visible. Obnamfs uses the same configuration file as plain obnam.
Those obnam command line options that are relevant for obnamfs work in
the identical way.

The virtual filesystem created this way is accessible only by the user
who ran obnamfs. That is, the root of the virtual filesystem is owned by
the user who ran obnamfs, and has 0700 permissions. All backed up files
have the same numeric owner and group, and the same permissions, as are
stored for them in the backup.

To unmount the filesystem, run the following command:

    fusermount -u MOUNTPOINT
    
where MOUNTPOINT is the same location you gave to obnamfs.

For more information about FUSE, see http://fuse.sourceforge.net/
