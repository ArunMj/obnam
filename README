README for Obnam, a backup program
==================================

This is an alpha version of Obnam, a backup system. This README needs
some serious work, but the following sample command lines hopefully
can get you going:

    ./cli.py --store=/foo/store --cache=/foo/cache -C $HOME backup .
    
        Back up everything in your home directory. Store backups in
        /foo in the sub-directories store and cache.
        
    ./cli.py --store=/foo/store --cache=/foo/cache generations
    
        Show the UUID of each generation (in time order) that exist in
        the backup.

    ./cli.py --store=/foo/store --cache=/foo/cache show-generations UUID
    
        Show the contents of a generation, given its UUID.
        
    ./cli.py --store=/foo/store --cache=/foo/cache forget UUID
    
        Remove the contents of a generation from the backup, given its
        UUID.

Please mail bug reports and suggestions to liw@iki.fi, thanks.

The file uuid.py is a separate work, included here for convenience.
A future version will be included in Python 2.5. It is licensed under
the Python Software Foundaion License used by Python itself. From
the author:

    uuid.py is now released in the Python Package Index (see python.org)
    and will be included in Python 2.5, so it is under the Python
    license like the rest of Python.

Since Obnam supports Python 2.4, uuid.py is included here.
