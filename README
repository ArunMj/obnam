Obnam, a backup program
=======================

Obnam is a backup program. It is currently in BETA quality, meaning that
all the necessary features should be there, but there are bugs that may
annoy you a lot, and performance may be entirely inadequate for you.
Hopefully using Obnam will no longer turn you bitter and hateful, and 
make you abandon all hope for civilisation, move into the rain forest, 
and talk to birds for the rest of your life.

It would be inadvisable to rely on Obnam as your only backup solution,
but it should be ready for feature evaluation use.


Home page
---------

The Obnam home page is at <http://braawi.org/obnam/>, see there
for more information.


Installation
------------

The source tree contains packaging for Debian. Run `debuild -us -uc` to
build an installation package.

On other systems, using the `setup.py` file should work: run
"python setup.py --help" for advice. If not, please report a bug.
(I've only tested `setup.py` enough for to build the Debian package.)

You need to install my Python B-tree library, and some of my other libraries 
and tools, which you can get from:

* <http://liw.fi/larch/>
* <http://liw.fi/ttystatus/>
* <http://liw.fi/coverage-test-runner/>
* <http://liw.fi/tracing/>

You also need third party libraries:

* paramiko: <http://www.lag.net/paramiko/>

Use
---

To get a quick help summary of options:

    ./obnam --help
    
To make a backup:

    ./obnam backup --repository /tmp/mybackup $HOME

For more information, see the manual page:

    man -l obnam.1 


Hacking
-------

The canonical version control repository for obnam itself is at:

    http://code.liw.fi/obnam/bzr/

The 'trunk' branch is the main development one. Note that the URL points
at a bzr repository, it is not useful to browse it by hand.

To build:

    make
    
To run automatic tests:

    make check 
    make network-tests # Requires ssh access to localhost.
    
You need my CoverageTestRunner to run tests, see above for where to get it.
A couple of scripts exist to run benchmarks and profiles:

    ./run-benchmark
    viewprof obnam.prof cumulative | less -S
    
viewprof is a little helper script I wrote, around the Python pstats module.
You can use your own, or get mine from extrautils (see above).

If you make any changes, I welcome patches, either as plain diffs, bzr
bundles, or public repositories I can merge from.

The code layout is roughly like this:

    obnamlib/               # all the real code
    obnamlib/plugins/       # the plugin code (see pluginmgr.py)
    obnam                   # script to invoke obnam
    _obnammodule.c          # wrapper around some system calls

In obnamlib, every code module has a corresponding test module,
and "make check" uses CoverageTestRunner to run them pairwise. For
each pair, test coverage must be 100% or the test will fail.
Mark statements that should not be included in coverage test with
"# pragma: no cover", if you really, really can't write a test.
without-tests lists modules that have no test modules.

If you want to make a new release of Obnam, I recommend following
my release checklist: <http://braawi.org/obnam/release/>.

Feedback
--------

I welcome bug fixes, enhancements, bug reports, suggestions, requests,
and other feedback. I prefer e-mail (<mailto:liw@liw.fi>).

There's a mailing list for Obnam users: send mail to
<mailto:obnam-help@braawi.org> for instructions.

It would be helpful if you can run `make clean check` before submitting
a patch, but it is not strictly required.
