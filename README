README for Obnam, a backup program
==================================

This is an alpha version of Obnam, a backup system. This README needs
some serious work, but the following sample command lines hopefully
can get you going:

    ./cli.py --store=/foo/store --cache=/foo/cache -C $HOME backup .
    
        Back up everything in your home directory. Store backups in
        /foo in the sub-directories store and cache.
        
    ./cli.py --store=/foo/store --cache=/foo/cache generations
    
        Show the UUID of each generation (in time order) that exist in
        the backup.

    ./cli.py --store=/foo/store --cache=/foo/cache show-generations UUID
    
        Show the contents of a generation, given its UUID.
        
    ./cli.py --store=/foo/store --cache=/foo/cache forget UUID
    
        Remove the contents of a generation from the backup, given its
        UUID.

Please mail bug reports and suggestions to liw@iki.fi, thanks.
