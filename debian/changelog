obnam (0.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix permissions of /etc/obnam/gpg and /etc/obnam/ssh. This fix only
    works on initial installations, but since there are no real installations
    yet, that's good enough.

obnam (0.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * A default configuration is now included in /usr/share/obnam/obnam.conf.
  * The directory /etc/obnam is created by default, so the sysadmin has a
    convenient place to put a configuration file.
  * /etc/obnam/gpg and /etc/obnam/ssh are likewise created for convenience.

obnam (0.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * First release of the .deb package. There have been prototypes privately
    packaged under different names, but this code is not directly derived
    from them, and neither is the packaging.
