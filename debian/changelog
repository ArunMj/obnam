obnam (0.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * A default configuration is now included in /usr/share/obnam/obnam.conf,
    and the directory /etc/obnam (and /etc/obnam/gpg) is now created by
    default.

obnam (0.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * First release of the .deb package. There have been prototypes privately
    packaged under different names, but this code is not directly derived
    from them, and neither is the packaging.
